# Downloads

File download feature without utilizing
the [Android Download Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager).

The downloaded files are saved to the "Downloads" directory, which is the standard location for
user-downloaded files.
Whenever possible, the files are downloaded with their original names and extensions. However, in
certain scenarios where the name cannot be inferred, a unique name is generated.
